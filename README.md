# Silai : A personal portfolio theme with blog

Silai (சிலை) means statue in Tamil, a south indian language.

If you are using `exampleSite` folder for scaffolding, please remove this line from `config.yml`:

```
themesdir: "../.."
```

That line is just to make the development of the theme work with `hugo server` command.
